I'm a software developer based in Melbourne, Australia, and currently working at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/).  Recently, I got the itch for DevOps related work and this type of work has been the theme of my last few projects.

I studied Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering at [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au/), Melbourne.

**_Geek bio_**: I got my first computer at age 14 (pretty old by today's standards eh?) after begging my mother to buy me a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) with a Datasette (basically a cassette tape reader for loading programs). I mostly played games but soon discovered BASIC programming and tried a bit of 6510 assembler. I knew then and there that I wanted to work with computers as a career. I'd often scour the local Trash and Treasure markets to find old abandoned personal computers and gaming devices and try to figure out how they worked. Some of beauties I found included an [Osborne 1](http://oldcomputers.net/osborne.html) - looks like a suitcase, [Amstrad CPC 464](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=84), [Sharp MZ-700](http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=87), and [Hitachi H2](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=581&st=1).

Outside of work I am into running.  I did ToughMudder, Melbourne in 2012!
